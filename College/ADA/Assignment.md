# ADA Lab Assignment Questions

1. **CNF-Boolean to Graph Conversion and SAT Problem**  
   Write a function of polynomial time complexity to convert a CNF-Boolean function into an equivalent graph. Thereafter, write a program to read a CNF-Boolean function and check whether it is satisfiable or not by checking if the corresponding graph has a clique of k vertices, where k is the number of sum terms in the CNF-Boolean function.

2. **Graph to CNF-Boolean Conversion and Clique Check**  
   Write a function in polynomial time complexity to convert an undirected graph into an equivalent CNF-Boolean function. Then, write a program to read the adjacency matrix of the graph and check whether it has a clique of k vertices or not by checking the satisfiability of the corresponding CNF-Boolean function, where k is entered by the user.
