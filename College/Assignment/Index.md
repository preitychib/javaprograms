# Java Assignment

### Index 

1. WAP in java to calculate the factorial of a number using BigInterger class and test it for a bigger number.
2. WAP in java to create a ragged array like staircase. Populate it with random values and print array on screen.
3. Write a Gaming app to guess the number in Java with the following rules:
    Display Message if user has entered number greater than the number.
    Display the number of attempts.
    Make use of GUI based input-output 
4. Define a class called Triangle which stores all the three sides of triangle. Use constructor to initialise the sides. Write a method called findArea which calculate area of triangle using herons formula. Also check the types of the triangle. Wrtite this java application using GUI I/O.
5. Define a class Matrix which stores set of values in a two dimensional array. The dimension of the matrix is passed through contructors, and necessary memory allocation is done. 
The class contains a method, called populate(int range), which randomly generates numbers betwee I-range and store it as matrix values. Create a function to add, subtract, multiply two matrix. 
Also write a recursive function to find the determinant of a matirx. Also add required method in the class so that values of the Matrix can be printed using System.out.println() method. Also write a test program to test the above class.matrix class
