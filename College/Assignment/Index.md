# Java Assignment

### Index 

1. >WAP in java to calculate the factorial of a number using BigInterger class and test it for a bigger number.
2. >WAP in java to create a ragged array like staircase. Populate it with random values and print array on screen.
3. >Write a Gaming app to guess the number in Java with the following rules:
    Display Message if user has entered number greater than the number.
    Display the number of attempts.
    Make use of GUI based input-output 
4. >Define a class called Triangle which stores all the three sides of triangle. Use constructor to initialise the sides. Write a method called findArea which calculate area of triangle using herons formula. Also check the types of the triangle. Wrtite this java application using GUI I/O.
5. >Define a class Matrix which stores set of values in a two dimensional array. The dimension of the matrix is passed through contructors, and necessary memory allocation is done. 
The class contains a method, called populate(int range), which randomly generates numbers betwee I-range and store it as matrix values. Create a function to add, subtract, multiply two matrix. 
Also write a recursive function to find the determinant of a matirx. Also add required method in the class so that values of the Matrix can be printed using System.out.println() method. Also write a test program to test the above class.matrix class
7. >Write down a menu driver program for a student registeration for the placement activity the registeration form consist of student_id, student_name, course and SGPA of the current semester and email_id. Whenever student is registered to an arraylist and if somebody do not want to request for departicipation and his/her name is deleted.
8. >WAP in Java that takes the paragraph of the text as input form the user and performs the following operations:
    1. Count the number of characters, words, and lines. 
    2. Make the entire sentence in sentence case 
    3. Reverse the order of the words eg: "Hello Everyone" should be "Everyone Hello"
    4. Also reverse the entire paragraph eg: "Hello Java" should be "avaJ olleH"
9. >Given a string, find all distinct palindrome sub-strings of length>1. For example, str="abaaa" then possible palindromic sub-strings are: aa,aaa,aba.
10. >Define a generic class to store set of three values (a,b,c) of generic type. The class contains two methods, namely sum() and product() of these three values. Write a test program which test the defined classes for three different data types.
11. >The k-mer refers to all the possible substrings of length k that are contained in a string. In genomics.k-mers refer to all the possible subsequences (of length k) in a given DNA Sequence. The number ofpossible k-mers given n possibilities (n-4 in the case of DNA eg. ACTG) is n'k. For example, if k = 1 there are 4 k-mers possible (ie. A, C, T, G ) in case of k = 2 16 k-mers are possible (e.g. AA AT AC AG TA TT TC TG CA CT CC CG GA GT GC GG). Write a program which takes a DNA sequence file and value of 'k as input from the user, and calculate the occurrence of k-mers, and store it to a CSV file(For example, if given DNA sequence S="ATTGCCC", K=2, then output should be as follows:
    * K-mers,Ocurrences
    *  AA,0
    *  AC,0
    *  AG,0
    *  AT,1
    *  CA,0
    *  CC,2
    *  CG,0
    *  CT,0
    *  GA,0
    *  GC,1
    *  GG,0
    *  GT,0
    *  TA,0
    *  TC,0
    *  TG,1
    *  TT,1 
12. >Write a GUI application for the students' registration process Student fills out registration forms comprised of first name, middle name, last name, father's name, city, state, email, mobile, DOB, qualification, etc. After form submission, data must be stored in a database table. The application should also have the facility to search and display the submitted forms. Make necessary assumptions, if any.
13. >Write a program to store marks of five courses into a database table. The program takes inputs such as enrolment, marks of 5 courses and store it to a database table using JDBC APIs. Make necessary assumption about the database and tables.
14. >Suppose we have three sets A,B,C with its elements as strings in thousands. The content of each set A,B,C are stored in a .CSV file seperated by commas.
    * For example,
    *  a1,b1,c1
    *  a2,b2,c2
    * here the values of A={a1,a2}, B={b1,b2}, C={c1,c2}.
    > Write a program in java which reads the contents of set A,B, and C from the .CSV file and perform
    *    (i) A U B U C
    *    (ii) A ∩ B ∩ C
    *    (iii) (A ∩ B) U (A ∩ C) U (B ∩ C)
    *   Store these results in diferent colums of .CSV file.

15. >Write a multithreading program to demonstrate synchronization in a Reader-Writer problem for a shared limited buffer.
